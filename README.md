## ✏️ How to Update Content

### 1. Adding New Research Projects

Edit `_data/research.yml`:

```yaml
- title: "Your Research Project Title"
  advisor: "Prof. Advisor Name"
  period: "Start Date - End Date"
  status: "Ongoing/Completed"
  description: "Brief description of your research..."
  skills:
    - "Skill 1"
    - "Skill 2"
  links:
    - title: "GitHub"
      url: "https://github.com/username/repo"
```

### 2. Adding Publications

Edit `_data/publications.yml`:

```yaml
- type: "journal"  # or "preprint", "presentation", "thesis"
  title: "Paper Title"
  authors: ["Steven T.C. Tung", "Co-author"]
  journal: "Journal Name"
  year: "2024"
  abstract: "Paper abstract..."
  links:
    - title: "DOI"
      url: "https://doi.org/example"
```

### 3. Adding Mathematical Notes

**Step 1**: Upload your PDF to `assets/pdfs/`

**Step 2**: Edit `_data/notes.yml`:

```yaml
- title: "Note Title"
  topic: "Subject Area"
  date: "2024-MM-DD"  # Use YYYY-MM-DD format
  course: "Course Name (optional)"
  description: "Brief description"
  pages: 25
  pdf: "filename.pdf"
```

The notes page will automatically organize them by topic and list chronologically!

### 4. Updating Personal Information

**Homepage** (`index.md`):
- Edit the intro text and recent updates section
- Add your profile photo to `assets/images/profile.jpg` and uncomment the image line

**Contact Page** (`contact.md`):
- Update email, office hours, and contact information
- Update ORCID when available

**CV Page** (`cv.md`):
- Update the CV content directly in the file
- Upload your CV PDF to `assets/pdfs/steven_tung_cv.pdf`

### 5. Site Configuration

Edit `_config.yml` to update:
- Site title and description
- Email address
- GitHub username
- Navigation menu

## 📄 Managing PDF Files

1. **Upload Location**: Place all PDFs in `assets/pdfs/`
2. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores
   - ✅ `real_analysis_notes.pdf`
   - ❌ `Notes 1.pdf`
3. **File Sizes**: Keep PDFs under 25MB for faster loading

## 🎨 Customizing the Design

### Colors
The main colors are defined in `assets/css/main.css`:
- Primary: `#34495e` (dark blue-gray)
- Secondary: `#2c3e50` (darker blue-gray)
- Background: `#f8f9fa` (light gray)

### Fonts
- Headings: Helvetica Neue, Arial (clean, modern)
- Body text: Georgia, Times New Roman (academic, readable)

### Layout
The design is responsive and works on all devices. Maximum content width is 800px for optimal readability.

## 🔧 Advanced Customization

### Adding New Pages
1. Create a new `.md` file in the root directory
2. Add front matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: page
   title: "Page Title"
   ---
   ```
3. Add the page to navigation in `_config.yml`

### Creating Individual Note Pages
Instead of just linking to PDFs, you can create dedicated pages:

1. Create a file in `_notes/` directory
2. Use the `note` layout:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: note
   title: "Note Title"
   topic: "Subject"
   date: 2024-01-01
   pdf: "filename.pdf"
   ---

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment

### Automatic Deployment
- Every time you push changes to the main branch, GitHub automatically rebuilds your site
- Changes typically appear within 2-5 minutes

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Add a `CNAME` file with your domain name
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Enable HTTPS in repository settings

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
1. Check that repository is named `steventctung.github.io`
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Check for YAML syntax errors in your files

### Content Not Updating
1. Ensure proper YAML formatting (spaces, not tabs)
2. Check that file names match exactly in YAML files
3. Wait 5 minutes for GitHub to rebuild the site

### PDF Links Not Working
1. Verify PDF files are in `assets/pdfs/` directory
2. Check that filenames in YAML match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure PDF files are committed to the repository

## 📚 Mathematical Content Best Practices

### LaTeX to PDF Workflow
1. Write your notes in LaTeX
2. Compile to PDF
3. Name descriptively (e.g., `topology_chapter_3_notes.pdf`)
4. Upload to `assets/pdfs/`
5. Add entry to `_data/notes.yml`

### Note Organization
- Use consistent topic names (e.g., "Real Analysis", not "real analysis" or "Real analysis")
- Include page counts for user reference
- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Use proper date formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check this README first
2. Review the example entries in the YAML files
3. Ensure all syntax is correct (YAML is sensitive to formatting)
4. Contact your friend who set up the site for technical help
